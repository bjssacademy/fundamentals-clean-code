# Thinking Big

Structureing bigger apps

## Separation of concerns

srp - change together

example n-tier, discuss hexarch briefly

## Coupling and Cohesion

some things belong together as they change together
some things belong apart

## Modularity: Hide as much as you can

information hiding
encapsulation
private/public
packages - export as little as possible

## Dependency Inversion Principle

depend on abstractions

domain specific

## Published APIs

limit to naming and limited side effects
