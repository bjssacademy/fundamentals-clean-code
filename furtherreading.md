# Further Reading

A guide like this can only scratch the surface (pleasantly, we trust) of software design.

Here are our book recommendations to dive deeper

## Refactoring, Fowler

Refactoring by Martin Fowler is the classic guide to improving the design of code.

Refactoring consists of working in a series of small, repeatable steps that will change the structure of a program, without changing what it does.

The chapter thinking small outlines severl of the more common refactoring steps.

**This is essential reading for every developer**

## Refactoring Guru

This is an online course we use in Academy, with excellent free-to-use resources.

It covers Refactoring - the same as the book above - but in several languages and with interactive examples. It also covers _Code Smells_. This is the name given to those 'suspicions' we have that a piece of code could be improved. It provides a helpful catalogue of things to look out for.

## Agile Software Development, Martin

A comprehensive guide to the Object-Oriented style of software design. Focusses on the design-level choices using large worked examples. Great resource on SOLID, DIP and DI. More importantly, this book is a guide to deciding how, where and why to split up our code into smaller chunks

### Shameless plug section

[Java OOP Done Right on Amazon UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Java-OOP-Done-Right-oriented/dp/1527284441) A plain-English guide to using Object Oriented Programming _well_. This book has the ideas of clean code, modularity and separation of concerns built-in to it. It also shows you how to apply the ideas in this guide (plus more) to the Java language.
